                        <p>Abarth & C. was founded in Bologna on 31 March 1949.</p>
                        <p>Like many automotive firms of the time, it bore the name of its main founder, Carlo Abarth - who incorporated the company together with his friend Guido Scagliarini - and it took the Scorpion, symbol of his sign of the zodiac, Scorpio, as its badge.</p>

                <h1>The <br>Abarth philosophy</h1>
                <p>
                    Abarth’s cars needed to be manageable, strong in performance and powerful cars, but especially small and ‘dangerous’, just like a scorpion.
                    The ‘derivatives’ achieved succeses in all the competitions and Carlo Abarth put many records on his name.
                    In the ‘fifties’ of the twentieth century and during the ‘sixties’, the Abarth brand kept on building its name for sport, tuning en performance and they changed the world of the sports cars.

                        <h2>1949<br>Carlo Abarth's zodiac sign</h2>
                        <p>Abarth was the Scorpion and the Scorpion was Abarth, right from the start in 1949.</p>
                        <p>Abarth chose the Scorpion as the symbol of his fledgling company for three reasons: it stood for his sign of the zodiac; it was hard to counterfeit; and above all it was an original badge which perfectly encapsulated the Abarth philosophy: "small but mean".</p>
                        <p>The initial badge consisted only of the Scorpion, without a shield or frame, with the words “Abarth & Cº - Torino” beneath it.</p>

                        <p>Like the phoenix, the Scorpion was reborn from its ashes.</p>
                        <p>Its new role as an independent brand in the Fiat Group constellation coincided with a complete restyling of the new logo.</p>
                        <p>The new version included the Scorpion's distinctive features and the brand's heritage was maintained, but in a decidedly more modern, up-to-date interpretation.</p>
                        <p>The Scorpion was the same shape as in the previous logos, but it was rotated to the left and the claws were now on the diagonal line separating the red and yellow sections of the shield.</p>
                        <p>In this version, the name "Abarth" was in white on a black background, in a completely new font, with the letters at the ends compressed. The Italian flag was now lower down, below the name.</p>
                        <p>This new logo was also produced in a "3D" version, with the grey replaced by a chromed steel effect.</p>
