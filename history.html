                        <p>
                            The legend started with a challenge, starring Carlo Abarth.<br>
                            <br>
                            The young Carlo was only eleven years old when he covered the steering wheel of his motor scooter with a leather belt to beat the older children in the neighbourhood.
                            This experience is part of Carlo Abarth’s DNA . He couldn’t resist the temptation of racing and got driven to new challenges and new records.

                        <h2>Abarths foundation</h2>
                        <p>
                            In 1949, after his racing career ended, Carlo Abarth started Abarth & C., together with Guido Scagliarini. The first cars built were models belonging to Cisitalia - in receivership at the time - which Piero Dusio ceded to Carlo Abarth in payment for his work for the Turin firm. Abarth also kept on 20 Cisitalia workers and the company's site at Via Trecate 10 in Turin. Their first car was the 204 A Roadster, based on the FIAT 1100. He immediately won the 1100 Sport Championship and the Formula 2.<br>
                            <br>
                            The Abarth 204A Roadster sports car performed impressively in road races from the outset, but it was in the 1950 Palermo-Montepellegrino hill climb that it recorded its biggest success. Abarth distinguished itself for the category victory achieved by the great Tazio Nuvolari, competing in - and winning - the last race of his legendary career.<br>
                            <br>
                            This marked the start of the Scorpion myth.

                        <h2>The succes of Abarth exhaust</h2>
                        <p>
                            Although Abarth's debut brought impressive wins, on the down side the economic demands of funding the racing team immediately became apparent. Carlo Abarth made the astute choice of entering the market for mechanical components, for use for tuning purposes, to add personality and power to mass-produced cars.<br>
                            <br>
                            This led to the development of Abarth exhausts, lined with glass wool.<br>
                            <br>
                            Presented at the 1950 Turin Motor Show, these unusual racing exhausts were produced in an edition of just 50, and only for the Topolino.<br>
                            <br>
                            This new addition gave the Fiat runabout a slight power boost and a decidedly aggressive sound.<br>
                            <br>
                            The idea made big waves and became increasingly popular with enthusiasts. In the wake of this success, Abarth began to manufacture more components, including manifolds, valves and steering-column gear levers. These components were available for cars built by the main constructors, and especially for Fiats, starting from the 600.<br>
                            <br>
                            The name Abarth became synonymous with tuning.

                        <h2>The age of records</h2>
                        <p>
                            Love of a sporting challenge was in the Scorpion brand's genes. And to prove this to the public at large, Abarth decided to conquer new international records.<br>
                            <br>
                            The first was achieved on the weekend of 17 and 18 June 1956. At the wheel of the Fiat Abarth 750 Record with Bertone bodywork, drivers Remo Cattini, Umberto Maglioli, Mario Poltronieri and Alfonso Thiele broke the record for the distance travelled in 24h: 3,743.642 km, with an average of 155.985 km/h.<br>
                            <br>
                            A month later, the same car broke an amazing five records in a single weekend. Record after record, the Abarth legend was established for all time: apart from the results, fans loved its approach, its dedication to constant improvement and the ability to achieve extraordinary performances by tuning the mechanicals of ordinary cars.<br>
                            <br>
                            Between 1956 and 1966 Abarth broke dozens of new records, bringing its total to 113. At present, the brand's honours board contains no fewer than 133.

                        <h2>Abarth tuning kits</h2>
                        <p>
                            Abarth's records inspired the world and everyone wanted to drive one of the Scorpion's cars. The Turin firm brought off the impressive feat of inventing a market in which it had no rivals: the tuning market.<br>
                            <br>
                            Starting from production of the individual components (Abarth exhausts also sold like hot cakes abroad and tens of thousands of units were produced), Abarth moved on to a broader, more complete vision. The firm produced the Abarth tuning kits , sold in special wooden boxes (which gained iconic status), containing mechanical components and original accessories for converting Fiat cars. <br>
                            <br>
                            Customers had two options: they could purchase a converted car from Abarth or have the kit installed on their own vehicle by an authorised workshop.<br>
                            <br>
                            With Abarth tuning kits, an ordinary, mass-produced road car could be transformed into a real sports car in a few simple steps.

                        <h2>The move to Corso Marche</h2>
                        <p>
                            By the mid Fifties the Via Trecate workshop was already too small to house Abarth's new operations and expanding sales.<br>
                            <br>
                            Carlo Abarth wished to consolidate the business in Turin, where the car market was booming, but he knew he had to find larger premises if he wanted to plan for further growth.<br>
                            <br>
                            In 1958, the year when he tuned the newborn Fiat Nuova 500 and set six international records on the Monza circuit, Abarth decided to make his move. He found a new site in a much larger building at Corso Marche, 38, near the Campo Volo, the light aircraft and glider airfield which Aeroclub Torino allowed the Abarth engineers to use for testing new cars.<br>
                            <br>
                            The Scorpion now had 160 employees, working in those years on one of the brand's biggest commercial successes: the Fiat 500 conversion kits.

                        <h2>Abarth’s dual personality</h2>
                        <p>
                            Abarth's expansion enabled the firm to add the construction of its own models to its well established tuning business. In 1958 Abarth signed an agreement with Fiat under which it took delivery of semi-completed car bodies which were then prepared with custom components. The Fiat 600 D provided the basis for the Fiat-Abarth 850 TC, which boosted the company's racing and commercial success, and the 1000 Berlinetta. They were followed by the 595, 595 SS and 695 SS models derived from the Fiat 500.<br>
                            <br>
                            In 1964 annual output of exhaust systems exceeded the two hundred thousand mark. Abarth had become an institution, especially amongst the youngest drivers, who wanted to "abarthize" their mass-produced cars to make them more powerful and aggressive.<br>
                            <br>
                            In the late 1960s, Abarth decided to join Formula 1 and it focused its attention on developing an innovative 6 litre V12 engine. Unfortunately, the change in FIA rules put an end to this ambitious project, and Abarth found itself facing a looming crisis.

                        <h2>Abarth, Fiat racing team</h2>
                        <p>
                            Abarth was already the de facto Fiat racing team before 1971, although only at the unofficial level. In fact, an agreement signed in 1958 between Fiat CEO  Vittorio Valletta and Carlo Abarth awarded Abarth a cash bonus for every win achieved and record set by a Fiat car with Scorpion tuning.<br>
                            <br>
                            1971 was the year of the Formula Italia  racing car and the iconic Autobianchi A112 Abarth. The company now had a workforce of 400, but the international economic crisis forced Carlo Abarth to sell the business to Fiat, which had a much more ambitious plan for the Scorpion brand: to transform it into the company's official racing team and develop cars capable of winning international rallies.<br>
                            <br>
                            The formal handover took place on 15 October 1971. Carlo Abarth stayed with the business for a few more years as a consultant. Struck down by cancer, he died in Vienna in 1979.<br>
                            <br>
                            Abarth was placed in complete charge of the rally programme and the first successes were not long in coming: these were the years of the Fiat 124 Abarth Rally.

                        <h2>Fiat and Abarth: world champion</h2>
                        <p>
                            In spite of the excellent results achieved, culminating in two European titles, in the second half of the Seventies the Fiat 124 Abarth Rally had become obsolete in top-rank competition terms. The Fiat management stated its intention of switching to a racing version of the new 131 family saloon, and Abarth concentrated its efforts on developing this new model.<br>
                            <br>
                            The car made its debut in 1975 and achieved excellent results in 1976, but it was in 1977 that it turned in a record-breaking season which brought Fiat its first, highly coveted victory in the world constructors' championship.<br>
                            <br>
                            The car was amazing and went on and on winning: it repeated its world victory in 1978 and after an up-and-down 1979 it won again in 1980.<br>
                            <br>
                            In 1978 and 1980, FIAT recorded two "double" victories, because as well as the constructors' title, the Fiat 131 Abarth Rally also enabled first Markku Alén and then Walter Röhrl to win the world drivers' championship.

                        <p>
                            Aware of the expertise and technology Abarth could offer, Fiat also decided to exploit this strategic factor in Endurance races and rallies. So in 1977 Abarth also took over the management of the Lancia Racing Team and competed in the WRC and WEC, where the 037 and Montecarlo Turbo proved unbeatable: both were to win world titles.<br>
                            <br>
                            After Carlo Abarth's death in 1979, all Abarth's efforts were focused on racing, and its normal production car business was gradually abandoned. Apart from a few new models produced in the early '80s (including the 1981 Ritmo Abarth 125 TC and the 130 TC, a 1983 restyling), Abarth's production operations were reduced to the long-lived A112, phased out in 1984 after almost fifteen years, with over 120,000 cars sold.
                            <br>
                            However, the Scorpion kept its sting in the racing world, thanks to its engineers, who developed the stunning design of the "Queen of Rallying". The Lancia Delta HF - in 4WD and Integrale versions - dominated the world championship from 1987 to 1992, and established itself as the supreme rally car in the minds of all enthusiasts.

                        <h2>The scorpion renaissance</h2>
                        <p>
                            The legend remained very much alive in the '90s, when construction was limited to a few prototypes, while the Abarth engineers concentrated on the Alfa Racing department, which won the European GT championship with the 155.<br>
                            <br>
                            The Fiat Group's top management realised that the Scorpion brand's badge and history still had plenty of appeal for young drivers, so in 2007 Abarth was relaunched as an independent brand.<br>
                            <br>
                            The new division conserved the pillars central to Abarth throughout its history: performance, craftsmanship and technical upgrading.<br>
                            <br>
                            The first car to appear was the Abarth Grande Punto, which was also available in “esseesse” trim for real enthusiasts, and which - in the S2000  racing version - won victories and international titles in the rally championships. <br>
                            <br>
                            This was followed in 2008 by the debut of the Abarth 500 which, when the Punto went out of production, became the Turin firm's key model, a success which still continues today. In 2016 the 500 was joined by the Abarth 124 spider and its rally derivation, with which Abarth returned to the WRC and won the FIA R-GT Cup in 2018.
