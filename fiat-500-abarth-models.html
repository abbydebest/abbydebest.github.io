                        <p>
                            Fiat introduced the Abarth version of the 500 at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show as a pocket-rocket city car developed for fun.
                            The world financial crisis was about to begin in Europe. It was already known in the North American market, and Fiat definitely knew what would follow. And yet, it didn't back up and still offered this pumped-up version of the 500, and it did that in cooperation with Abarth, the company's motorsports specialist. The idea of re-connecting the Abarth with the 500 was made due to the success recorded by the 1960s 500 Abarths in races.

                        <p>
                            The esseesse started as an add-on pack to the Fiat 500 Abarth, cranking up the power and sportiness levels another notch up.
                            So, if you had a 500 Abarth laying around with under 20,000 miles you could have ordered the kit, which came in a nice wooden box with Abarth logos, and go crazy with it.
                            The kit added cross-drilled brakes, a stiffer suspension, 17-inch alloy rims, a new ECU, special badges and a performance air filter.
                            The Abarth 500 esseesse could be had already built by the factory a bit later. The weight remains the same with the standard Abarth 500, but the extra 30 HP and the tuned suspension do make a considerable difference.

                        <p>
                            The Fiat 500 Abarth brought world-class performance and precision, purposeful and aggressive styling, high power-to-weight ratio and limited-production volume to North American driving enthusiasts in 2012.
                            Adding even more excitement to Karl Abarth's line of "small but wicked" cars, the new 2013 Fiat 500C Abarth Cabrio harks back to his open-air track cars of the 1960s, while delivering the most visceral experience of any modern Cinquecento to date.
                            With the Fiat 500 Abarth's high-performance DNA intact, the new 2013 Fiat 500C Abarth is engineered with the same track-proven attributes that have made the hatchback model a success on European and North American roadways and racetracks, but now brings even more fresh air and the unmistakable Abarth-tuned exhaust note into the cabin.
                            With just the push of a button, the Fiat 500C Abarth's power-operated cloth top retracts up to the rear spoiler during speeds up to a best-in-class 60 mph (a midway point can be chosen by pressing the button anytime in between).
                            Press the roof button again, and the roof will neatly fold all the way open and tuck neatly behind the rear head restraints (up to 50 mph). The power operated cloth top is also intelligently designed.

                        <h1>Fiat 595 Abarth</h1>
                        <h2>2012-2015</h2>
                        <p>
                            The sporty car was inspired by the history 595 model, released in 1963. The Abarth 595 was highly anticipated when it was released in 2012.<br>
                            <br>
                            The exterior design of the Abarth was pretty much the same, with the exception of side skirts that were redesigned for better aerodynamics and the front bumper with large air vents. The specifc Abarth logo was also present on one side.<br>
                            <br>
                            Inside the small Abarth you could find a nice combination of leather colors, with a unique flat-bottomed steering wheel, all wrapped up in leather with nice stitchings on the inside.<br>
                            <br>
                            The sporty seats were manually adjustable and offered good comfort for the front passengers, while the nicely designed rear seats were a match for short people only, due to no headroom and reduced legroom.<br>
                            <br>
                            The 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine developed 160, and while it might not sound like a lot, the Abarth was a light car, and the combination of power and weight made it a fast vehicle.<br>
                            <br>
                            The engine was mated to a 5-speed manual transmission, the only option available for this model.
                        </p>
                        <h2>2016-2021</h2>
                        <p>
                            The little Fiat 500 was sold in over 1.5 million units before it received an ample refresh in 2015. With its charm and a nimble ride, the 500 received numerous updates inside and out.<br>
                            <br>
                            The Fiat 500 might be called the Fiat brand savior. The charming little car was charming enough to bring back the Fiat brand in the U.S. And it was received as a fashion item more than a transportation device. Despite its small engines and lilliputian size, it fitted well between the big SUVs such as its relatives from RAM. And its powerful Abarth 595 added more grunt to the little car.<br>
                            <br>
                            The 2016 Fiat 500 Abarth received a new design for the headlights and taillights. It also received LED daytime running lights. The new oversized air intake in the front bumper improved the cooling capacity by 18%. The rear bumper featured a more pronounced diffuser, for better ground effect.<br>
                            <br>
                            The engine bay hosted a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine, but with different power outputs depending on the trim level. The 595 and 595 Turismo versions were offered with 145 hp and 160 hp, respectively, while the 595 Competizione (Racing) was boosted up to 180 hp. The standard gearbox for all Abarth 595 was a 5-speed manual, and a 5-speed auto was available at extra cost.

                        <p>
                            Fifty years after the original model was introduced to the world, the Fiat Abarth 695 once again hit the Geneva Motor Show in 2014 floor.
                            It also gained the “Biposto” name sticked at the back, meaning it has room only for two and is ready to race anytime.
                            The 695 Biposto ditches most of the convenience features making for the most extreme 500 ever built.
                            It comes with front mounted intercooler, Akrapovich exhaust, Extreme Shox adjustable shock absorbers, MXL digital data logger, Abarth Corsa by Sabelt seats with 4-point belts, Brembo brakes, light 18-inch OZ wheels and a rear titanium roll bar.
                            Rear seats, audio system, xenon headlamps, foglights, climate control and the electric windows are all gone here, leaving the car weight only 997 kg.
                            There are several customization kits available for the Abarth 695 Biposto, which can sweeten the pot by adding an aluminum hood, titanium water/oil/fuel caps, carbon fiber mirror casings and interior trimmings as well as driver personalized racing gear.
